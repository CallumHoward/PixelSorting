ADAD3402 - Pixel Sorting Sketch
===============================

This prototype is a C++ application created using the Cinder framework. It captures input from a camera source and sorts the pixels. It demonstrates the viability of real-time high-framerate pixel sorting. Further work should be completed to increase the block size used for sorting, and to selectively sort only parts of the image.

Dependencies
------------
- Cinder 0.9.2dev
